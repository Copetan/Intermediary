# Orinthe/Intermediary mappings

This repository contains the match information between different versions of Minecraft created by the Orinthe project, as well as the "intermediary" mappings we use, that is an intermediary naming form which tries to keep names
the same across versions and mapping changes.

## Files included in this repo

* __mappings/<mcversion>.tiny__: Intermediary mappings in the Tiny mapping format.
* __matches/releases/gameversion/*.matches__: Matches between Minecraft versions, created by the Orinthe project with the aid of Matcher.

## Generating / updating mappings

## License

As with the named mappings, we provide the intermediary mappings under the Creative Commons Zero license, so all can benefit.
